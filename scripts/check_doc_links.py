"""Resolve every relative link and heading anchor in the repository's markdown.

Link rot is silent. A broken `[text](path)` still renders as a link, and a
broken `#anchor` still navigates -- to the top of the file -- so a reader
lands somewhere plausible and assumes the section moved. Ported from the sibling agentic-pm-lab repository, where five such anchors
were live when it was written -- three of them in one file's own table of
contents. This repository was clean at the time of porting, so this gate
exists to keep it that way rather than to repair it.

Two details decide whether this catches anything or quietly passes on broken
input, and both are the reason a hand-rolled version of this check failed
earlier:

- **Fences.** A `## Heading` inside a ``` block is example content, not a
  heading. Treating it as one invents anchors that do not exist and, worse,
  hides real misses behind phantom matches.
- **GitHub's slug rules.** Punctuation is stripped and then *each remaining
  space* becomes one hyphen, so `AWS Bedrock & AgentCore` yields
  `aws-bedrock--agentcore` with two hyphens. Collapsing whitespace -- the
  intuitive implementation -- reports every such heading as broken.

External URLs are deliberately not fetched: a network-dependent check turns
an unrelated outage into a failed build.

    Four details decide whether this matches the real renderer. Fences and the
    space-to-hyphen rule are described above; two more are structural.

    ATX headings may be indented up to three spaces and may carry a closing
    run of hashes (`## Section ##`), both legal in CommonMark. Matching on a
    bare `startswith("#")` misses the first and leaves a trailing hyphen on
    the second, and a `#` with no following space is not a heading at all --
    each of which reports a working link as broken, or accepts a broken one.

    Repeated heading text is disambiguated by GitHub with a numeric suffix:
    three `### Using it` headings yield `using-it`, `using-it-1`, `using-it-2`.
    Collecting into a set without that collapses them, so a link to the second
    or third would be reported broken.
